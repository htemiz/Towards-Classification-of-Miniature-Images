### Overview
Miniatures are small images used to drawn on manuscripts to visually describe the subject of the manuscripts. 
Miniature paintings are made to provide a better understanding of what is told in the texts or to strengthen 
the narration. Ottomans used the miniatures between 14th and 18th centuries.

They depict portraits, lives of sultans, festivals, historical events, life style, nature and city views, 
literary works, religious subjects, traditions and customs, women and men, and creatures such as animals and plants.

In this work aimed to teach computer to identify the artists of the miniatures from given images. To accomplish this, 
a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained with some miniature images of four different artists. 

### Dataset[Decusr_4RB.py](models%2FDecusr_4RB.py)
Dataset consists of 380 images belonging the following four artists: 
Levni, Matrakçı Nasuh, Rumuzi and Seyyid Lokman. The images were downloaded from [https://www.turkishculture.org](https://www.turkishculture.org)

### Algorithms
Entire experiment is done with Keras. The architecture of the algorithms as follows.
